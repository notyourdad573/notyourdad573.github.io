So this one was actually pretty fun.

My friend let me test his Windows Server home lab. Full written permission. The goal wasn’t to “hack him” — it was to see how quickly weak security could turn into full compromise.

## Lab Workflow Overview

## Step 1: Recon

First thing I did was scan the host to see what was exposed.

I ran a full TCP SYN scan across all ports to see what was listening. Pretty quickly I saw something interesting — RDP was exposed.

Port 3389 open.

That immediately tells you two things:
1. Remote access is enabled
2. If credentials are weak, it’s game over

RDP exposed to the network without extra protection (VPN, MFA, lockout policies) is risky.

## Step 2: Testing Authentication Strength

Since this was a lab environment, I tested password strength using credential auditing tools against the RDP service.

After running through several common password lists, I was able to authenticate as a standard user.

At that point, I connected using a remote desktop client and was brought to the Windows login screen.

Logging in successfully was the moment it hit — this was a full remote shell into his system.

User-level access achieved.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation

Once inside, I started poking around.

It didn’t take long to find another account with elevated privileges.

Same process. Same test.

Weak credentials again.

After authenticating as the admin account, I had full control of the system.

It even kicked him off the machine when I logged in.

If this were a real attacker, they could have:
- Changed passwords
- Locked the owner out
- Installed persistence
- Deployed ransomware
- Exfiltrated data

And all of that started from one exposed service and weak credentials.

## What This Lab Taught Us

This wasn’t about breaking in for fun. It was about proving a point.

Security basics matter.

- Don’t expose RDP directly to the internet
- Use strong passwords
- Enable account lockout policies
- Use MFA
- Put RDP behind a VPN

It took less time than you’d think.

## Shoutout

Big shoutout to Tylor for letting me test against his homelab and trusting me with full access.
